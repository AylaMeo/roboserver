socket.io for real time client updates?

Pre-meeting:

  Renderer:
    improve camera controls
    color cubes based on hardness
    switch over to whatever the new data format will be

  Scanner:
    figure out new data format to allow various scan volumes
    make the data format smaller as well?
    see if code can be optimized to use less memory
    send scans in smaller batches

  Have robots send command results back to the server

  add dead reckoning for robots

  Add buttons for commonly used robot commands (i.e. forward, back)



Post-meeting:

  Set up database
  persistent server side maps that robots can read
  Add ability to send commands to different robots
  add ability to send scans to different maps
  Add password to commands, different per robot
  detect maximum batch size based on available memory
  don't add to the scene any voxels which are surrounded?


distant future:
neural network to help predict block ids from hardness maps
blueprint storage and rendering

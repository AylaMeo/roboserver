# Roboserver

This project lets you control [OpenComputers](http://ocdoc.cil.li/) robots through a simple GUI. No Lua coding necessary!

Here are a few things the Roboserver simplifies:
* Digging large areas
* Crafting complex items
* Repetitive construction
* Locating ore underground
* [And more!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lbb0-yfSdw)

## Getting Started

(Tested on Minecraft version 1.10.2, OpenComputers version 1.6. If something's broken for your version, see [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs).)

If you're looking to get set up as fast as possible, you can become a [patron](https://www.patreon.com/dunstad) to gain access to the desktop version of the Roboserver. See how to start using it [here](documentation/standalone-install.md).

Alternatively, if you've got a bit of technical know-how and more time on your hands, you can run the Roboserver from the source code by following the instructions [here](documentation/server-install.md).

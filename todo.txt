now:

  set view distance for scanForward and scanArea
  toggle for scanning with goto command

  add inventory information
    display contents of robot inventory and current selected space

  add crafting program

  how to specify areas to dig?

later:

  allow limited functionality without geolyzer

  move ip address information to a settings file

  camera
    go to robot location

  command-loop
    make command loop environment modules not global

  store robot orientation and position on hard disk, not just in memory

  stop command input from sending on blur (caused by using change event)

  renderer:
    store all voxels by coordinates
    update existing voxels instead of placing a new one on top of old ones
    render robot facing (triangular prism)
      send orientation
    display coordinates of the voxel being looked at
    improve rendering color schemes
    make water/lava transparent

  mapping:
    Set up database
    persistent server side maps that robots can read
    add ability to send scans to different maps
    detect maximum scan batch size based on available memory
    don't add to the scene any voxels which are surrounded?

  Add ability to send commands to different robots
  Add password to commands, different per robot
    store hashed password with random salt in db
    also store hash on robot, check only that hash for commands

distant future:
  implement minecraft player style inventory manipulation on web-client
  blueprint storage and rendering
  neural network to help predict block ids from hardness maps

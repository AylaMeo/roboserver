#### Creative

Set down the Creatix robot, run ```install```, select OpenOS, and reboot it when the install completes. Make sure to put a Geolyzer in its upgrade slot (not its tool slot!).

Now that your robot is running and OpenOS is installed, just paste [this](web_install.txt) into it.
(If your Roboserver is running but you don't have internet access, you can use the [local install](local_install.txt) instead.)

After answering a few questions about your robot, it will connect to the server you started in the previous step. Congratulations, you're done! Next check out [these tips](tips.md) on how to use the Roboserver.

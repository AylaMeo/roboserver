#### Survival

If you have no previous experience with OpenComputers, you should take a look at [this guide](http://ocdoc.cil.li/tutorial:oc1_basic_computer).

You need to craft at minimum the following parts for your robot:
* [Computer Case (Tier 2)](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/computer_case_tier_2/)
* [EEPROM (Lua BIOS)](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/eeprom_lua_bios/)
* [CPU (Tier 2)](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/central_processing_unit_cpu_tier_2/)
* [Memory (Tier 1)](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/memory_tier_1/) x2
* [Hard Disk Drive (Tier 1)](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/hard_disk_drive_tier_1/) with [OpenOS](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/floppy_disk_openos/) installed
* [Internet Card](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/internet_card/)
* [Geolyzer](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/geolyzer/)
* [Inventory Upgrade](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/inventory_upgrade/)
* [Inventory Controller Upgrade](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/inventory_controller_upgrade/)
* [Crafting Upgrade](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/crafting_upgrade/)

Unless you really know what you're doing, you probably need these too:
* [Keyboard](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/keyboard/)
* [Screen](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/screen_tier_1/)
* [Graphics Card (Tier 1)](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/graphics_card_tier_1/)

Place all these parts in an [Electronics Assembler](http://crafting-guide.com/browse/opencomputers/electronics_assembler/). Power and start the assembler, and when your robot is finished, place it in the world and power it on.

Now that your robot is running and OpenOS is installed, just paste [this](install.txt) into it.

After answering a few questions about your robot, it will connect to the server you started in the previous step. Congratulations, you're done! Next check out [these tips](tips.md) on how to use the Roboserver.

now:
    
  dig area behaving strangely (related to air blocks?)
  add gui support for interact, place, equip

  add crafting program

later:

  drop items

  stop robot from losing contact through code updates

  add moveVoxel for robot movement?

  render \t properly in robot responses

  message div blocking click to engage camera control

  allow limited functionality without geolyzer

  move ip address information to a settings file

  camera
    go to robot location

  commandLoop
    make command loop environment modules not global

  store robot orientation and position on hard disk, not just in memory

  renderer:
    render robot facing (triangular prism)
      send orientation
    improve rendering color schemes
    make water/lava transparent

  mapping:
    Set up database
    persistent server side maps that robots can read
    add ability to send scans to different maps
    detect maximum scan batch size based on available memory
    don't add to the scene any voxels which are surrounded?

  Add ability to send commands to different robots
  Add password to commands, different per robot
    store hashed password with random salt in db
    also store hash on robot, check only that hash for commands

distant future:
  implement minecraft player style inventory manipulation on web-client
  blueprint storage and rendering
  neural network to help predict block ids from hardness maps

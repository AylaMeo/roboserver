Pre-meeting:

  command-loop
    allow breaking out of command loop on robot
    return values of some commands are being reported strangely, test with robot.up() etc
    make command loop environment modules not global

  Add buttons for commonly used robot commands (i.e. forward, back, place, dig)

  renderer
    merge meshes together to speed up rendering
    make water/lava transparent
    render robot facing (triangular prism)


  send new scan data after moving
    for up or down, send the whole plane
    buttons for movement with scanning and movement without scanning

  camera
    go to robot location?

  update readme
  how to remember to add code directory to package.path so requires work?

Post-meeting:

  store robot orientation and position on hard disk, not just in memory

  stop command input from sending on blur (caused by using change event)

  renderer:
    display coordinates of the voxel being looked at

  mapping:
    Set up database
    persistent server side maps that robots can read
    add ability to send scans to different maps
    detect maximum scan batch size based on available memory
    don't add to the scene any voxels which are surrounded?

  Add ability to send commands to different robots
  Add password to commands, different per robot
    store hashed password with random salt in db
    also store hash on robot, check only that hash for commands

  display contents of robot inventory and current selected space


distant future:
  implement minecraft player style inventory manipulation on web-client
  prediction for inventory and movement?
  blueprint storage and rendering
  neural network to help predict block ids from hardness maps

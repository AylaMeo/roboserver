now:

  add some way to select a listening robot in the interface
  send the selected robot name with commands
  
  move lua code from the client-side interface to the server

  see if we can make water source and flow blocks render differently

  robot can't put water in bucket from above the water? investigate

later:

  listen for error type messages in command loop?

  use furnaces automatically during crafting

  inventory:
    drop items
    add external->external transfer support (use a robot slot)

  lua:
    stop robot from losing contact through code updates
    allow limited functionality without geolyzer/other components
    make command loop environment modules not global
    store robot orientation and position on hard disk, not just in memory

  interface:
    render \t properly in robot responses
    message div blocking click to engage camera control

  move ip address information to a settings file

  renderer:
    remove robot afterimage when moving after scan
    add moveVoxel for robot movement?
    render robot facing (triangular prism or different colored face)
      send orientation
    improve rendering color schemes
    make water/lava transparent
    camera: go to robot location

  make account registration create a new robot if server is on no-player mode

distant future:
  visual tool for chaining robot commands together to automate tasks
  edit lua files on robot with an editor in browser
  blueprint storage and rendering
  neural network to help predict block ids from hardness maps
  mapping:
    Set up database
    persistent server side maps that robots can read
    add ability to send scans to different maps? or is it one roboserver per mc server?
    detect maximum scan batch size based on available memory
    don't add to the scene any voxels which are surrounded?

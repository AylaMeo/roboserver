    have robots send their location and a scan on client connect
    move lua code from the client-side interface to the server
    easy set config program
    store robot orientation and position on hard disk, not just in memory
      make sure it's not too slow
    allow limited functionality without inventory/crafting components
  
  fixes:
    inventory covers buttons
      add toggle visibility button to each table
      also move them
    make command loop environment modules not global
    decrease page load time?
  
  pre-release:
    set up github so i can develop without breaking the release
    update readme
      make a list of components required for full functionality
        internet card, geolyzer, inventory controller, crafting upgrade, minimum 16 slots of inventory space
        optional chunk loader
    test things
    make a video

later:

  fixes:
    robot can't put water in bucket from above the water? investigate

  features:

    drop items function in interface
    add moveVoxel for lighter robot movement in rendering code
    make water/lava transparent

  blueprint storage and rendering
  neural network to help predict block ids from hardness maps
  mapping:
    Set up database
    persistent server side maps that robots can read
    add ability to send scans to different maps? or is it one roboserver per mc server?
    detect maximum scan batch size based on available memory
    don't add to the scene any voxels which are surrounded?

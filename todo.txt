now:

  improve crafting code

  work on login

later:

  use furnaces automatically during crafting

  inventory:
    drop items
    add external->external transfer support (use a robot slot)

  lua:
    stop robot from losing contact through code updates
    allow limited functionality without geolyzer/other components
    make command loop environment modules not global
    store robot orientation and position on hard disk, not just in memory

  interface:
    render \t properly in robot responses
    message div blocking click to engage camera control

  move ip address information to a settings file

  renderer:
    remove robot afterimage when moving after scan
    add moveVoxel for robot movement?
    render robot facing (triangular prism or different colored face)
      send orientation
    improve rendering color schemes
    make water/lava transparent
    camera: go to robot location

  mapping:
    Set up database
    persistent server side maps that robots can read
    add ability to send scans to different maps
    detect maximum scan batch size based on available memory
    don't add to the scene any voxels which are surrounded?

  Add ability to send commands to different robots
  Add password to commands, different per robot
    store hashed password with random salt in db
    also store hash on robot, check only that hash for commands

distant future:
  blueprint storage and rendering
  neural network to help predict block ids from hardness maps

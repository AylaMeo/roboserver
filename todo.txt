make git issues for these things
make a modded 1.10.2 world with opencomputers and mekanism

Renderer:
  improve camera controls
  color cubes based on hardness
  switch over to whatever the new data format will be
  don't add to the scene any voxels which are surrounded? (difficult with multiple nearby scans)
  
Scanner:
  figure out new data format to allow various scan volumes
  make the data format smaller as well?
  see if code can be optimized to use less memory
  send scans in smaller batches
  detect maximum batch size based on available memory

Have robots send command results back to the server
Add ability to send commands to different robots
add ability to send scans to different maps
add dead reckoning for robots
Set up database
Add password to commands, different per robot
Add buttons for commonly used robot commands (i.e. forward, back)
persistent server side maps that robots can read

distant future:
neural network to help predict block ids from hardness maps
blueprint storage and rendering

# Roboserver

This program lets you control OpenComputers robots through a simple GUI. No Lua coding necessary!

## Getting Started

First off, there are two ways to run the Roboserver: as a standalone application, or as a server.

### Standalone

You can download Roboserver for Windows, OS X, or Linux [here](). Unpack and run it when the download finishes. Congratulations, you're halfway done!

### Server

You should probably skip this section unless you run your own Minecraft server and want to let your players access the Roboserver from their browser.

### Robot

You need a robot with at minimum the following parts:
* Gold Case
* EEPROM (Lua BIOS)
* T2 CPU
* T1 Memory x2
* T1 Hard Disk Drive with OpenOS installed
* Internet Card
* Geolyzer
* Inventory Upgrade
* Inventory Controller
* Crafting Upgrade

(If you decide to use Creatix, you'll have to give it a Geolyzer.)

Once your robot is running and OpenOS is installed, just run this command:

```
pastebin stillneedtodothis
```

After answering a few questions about your robot, it will connect to the server you started in the previous step. Congratulations, you're done! Check out [this guide](guide.md) for some helpful tips about using the Roboserver.

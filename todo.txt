version 1:

  features:
    write easy install script
      test new download script
    add some way to select a listening robot in the interface
    send the selected robot name with commands
    move lua code from the client-side interface to the server
    store robot orientation and position on hard disk, not just in memory
      make sure it's not too slow
  
  fixes:
    remove robot afterimage when moving after scan
    message div blocking click to engage camera control
    render \t properly in robot responses
    make command loop environment modules not global
  
  pre-release:
    update readme
    test things

later:

  fixes:
    robot can't put water in bucket from above the water? investigate

  features:
    have robot revert to older command loop version if updated one is broken
    see if we can make water source and flow blocks render differently
    render robot facing (triangular prism or different colored face)
      send orientation
    allow limited functionality without geolyzer/other components
      make a list of components required for full functionality
    add external->external transfer support (use a robot slot)
    drop items function in interface
    add moveVoxel for lighter robot movement in rendering code
    make water/lava transparent
    camera: go to robot location
    action recording feature to make automation easy
      specify number of loops, duration of sleep between
    use furnaces automatically during crafting
    improve rendering color schemes
    make account registration create a new robot if server is on no-player mode

distant future:
  visual tool for chaining robot commands together to automate tasks
  edit lua files on robot with an editor in browser
  blueprint storage and rendering
  neural network to help predict block ids from hardness maps
  mapping:
    Set up database
    persistent server side maps that robots can read
    add ability to send scans to different maps? or is it one roboserver per mc server?
    detect maximum scan batch size based on available memory
    don't add to the scene any voxels which are surrounded?
